## Future Computing Technology Assessment

Technology assessment initiatives at SURFsara within [**SURF Open Innovation Lab**](https://www.surf.nl/en/the-surf-cooperative/surf-open-innovation-lab)) has a clear goal of understanding the performance of numerous HPC and AI workloads. We evaluate these on upcoming computing technologies with a focus on performance analysis, collaboration and open sharing of results. It is an effort within SOIL to make benchmarking and analysis around future hardware reproducible, open and more engaging for the community. 

As a HPC center, we help researchers to solve challenges associated with their applications on our infrastructure. In this particular initiative, we focus on evaluating, assessing, and benchmarking modern and emerging computing architectures for several application domains such as high performance computing, machine Learning and data visualisation.
